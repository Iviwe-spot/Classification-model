This was an interesting project since data needed to be prepared for our modelðŸ§®
Since the output of the model was to classify text, the text has to be transformed.
Using one-hot encoding, which changes text data into a matrix format of 1/0 
Also one interesting thing, modifying the Neural-network parameter such as the activation functions, nodes and hidden layers.
